            <p>Children and adults alike lack literacy skills such as speaking,
                 writing legibly, grammar concepts, critical thinking and comprehension. 
                 This can lead to a lack of education and less opportunities in the future.</p>

                I considered aspects of distribution, cost, content, and production
                of my app and website before creating it to work out problems beforehand.

                I created 3 sketches of different scenarios that one might encounter 
                when using the app I would build. One would be the general format
                for English speaking individuals, one is how the app would look when questions are answered
                incorrectly or correctly, and one is a general format for Spanish speaking individuals.
