            <p>Children and adults alike lack literacy skills such as speaking,
                 writing legibly, grammar concepts, and critical thinking and comprehension. 
                 This leads to easy manipulation from people with more power, and a lack of belief 
                 in education and experience from people with lower literacy skills.  </p>
